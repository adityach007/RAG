# Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Projects ðŸ“š


This repository is dedicated to exploring and implementing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. RAG combines the power of large language models with the ability to retrieve relevant information from external knowledge sources, creating more accurate and reliable AI systems.

The projects and implementations here demonstrate how RAG can enhance language models by grounding their responses in specific documents, databases, or knowledge bases. This approach helps reduce hallucinations while allowing models to access and leverage precise, up-to-date information.

Whether you're interested in building better search systems, creating more accurate chatbots, or developing knowledge-intensive applications, this repository provides examples and implementations that showcase the potential of RAG architectures.
